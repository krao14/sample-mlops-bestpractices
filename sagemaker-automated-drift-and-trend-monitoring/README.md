## Architecture Diagram

![MLOps Architecture](docs/guides/MetaMonitoring.png)

> **End-to-End Flow**: This architecture shows the complete MLOps pipeline from data ingestion through training, deployment, inference monitoring, and governance. See [ARCHITECTURE_STEPS.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_STEPS.md) for detailed descriptions of each numbered step.

## Quickstart: Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement the 11-step architecture shown above. Each step corresponds to the numbered components in the diagram.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with credentials for the target account
- IAM permissions to create CloudFormation stacks, IAM roles, SageMaker domains, Lambda functions, and VPC resources
- A supported region (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, etc. — requires SageMaker + MLflow availability)

### Setup: Deploy with CloudFormation

The `cloudformation/` folder provides a single-stack deployment that provisions everything you need: SageMaker domain, user profile, JupyterLab space, MLflow tracking server, S3 data bucket, VPC, SQS inference logging queue, Lambda inference logger with event source mapping, and IAM execution role with all required permissions (S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, KMS, Lake Formation, CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics/Alarms/Dashboards, MLflow). On first space launch, the lifecycle script auto-clones this repo, generates synthetic datasets, uploads data to S3, creates Athena tables, and writes a populated `.env` file (including SQS queue URL).

**Deploy:**

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name fraud-detection-monitoring \
  --template-body file://cloudformation/sagemaker-mlflow-setup.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --region <your-region>

# Wait for stack creation (~10-15 minutes)
aws cloudformation wait stack-create-complete \
  --stack-name fraud-detection-monitoring \
  --region <your-region>
```

**After deploy:**

1. Open the SageMaker console → Domains → `fraud-detection-monitoring-domain`
2. Select the user profile and click **Spaces → Run Space**
3. Once JupyterLab starts, verify the lifecycle script completed:
   - `sample-mlops-bestpractices/` directory is present
   - `.env` file has AWS region, execution role, MLflow ARN, and data bucket populated
   - `CLOUDFORMATION_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` exists with next steps

**Get the MLflow UI URL:**

```bash
aws sagemaker describe-mlflow-tracking-server \
  --tracking-server-name fraud-detection-monitoring-mlflow \
  --query TrackingServerUrl --output text \
  --region <your-region>
```

**Optional parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `ProjectName` | `fraud-detection-monitoring` | Prefix for all named resources |
| `UserProfileName` | `fraud-detection-user` | SageMaker user profile name |
| `JupyterLabInstance` | `ml.t3.medium` | Instance type for JupyterLab space |
| `GitHubRepo` | This repo URL | Repository to clone |
| `UseExistingBucket` | `false` | Reuse an existing S3 bucket |
| `UseExistingRole` | `false` | Reuse an existing IAM role |
| `UseExistingVPC` | `false` | Reuse an existing VPC and subnets |

Pass parameters with `--parameters ParameterKey=<name>,ParameterValue=<value>`.

See **[`cloudformation/README.md`](cloudformation/README.md)** for full update/delete instructions and advanced troubleshooting.

### Troubleshooting: Lifecycle Script Failures

The lifecycle script runs automatically on first space launch. If it fails partway through (e.g., due to network issues or timeouts), some resources may not have been created. Check the lifecycle script logs in CloudWatch under `/aws/sagemaker/studio` filtered by your domain ID.

#### If S3 data upload failed

The lifecycle script generates synthetic datasets and uploads them to S3. If this step failed, run it manually from the JupyterLab terminal:

```bash
cd ~/sample-mlops-bestpractices/sagemaker-automated-drift-and-trend-monitoring

# Load environment variables
source .env 2>/dev/null || export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install .

# Generate synthetic datasets
python data/generate_datasets.py

# Rename generated files (drop "generated_" prefix)
mv data/generated_creditcard_predictions_final.csv data/creditcard_predictions_final.csv
mv data/generated_creditcard_drifted.csv data/creditcard_drifted.csv
mv data/generated_creditcard_ground_truth.csv data/creditcard_ground_truth.csv

# Upload to S3
python -m src.setup.upload_data_to_s3
```

Verify the upload succeeded:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://${DATA_S3_BUCKET}/fraud-detection/data/
# Expected output:
#   creditcard_predictions_final.csv
#   creditcard_ground_truth.csv
#   creditcard_drifted.csv
```

#### If Athena table creation failed

The lifecycle script creates the Athena database and Iceberg tables. If this step failed, run it manually:

```bash
cd ~/sample-mlops-bestpractices/sagemaker-automated-drift-and-trend-monitoring

# Load environment variables
source .env 2>/dev/null || export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# Create Athena database and all Iceberg tables
python -m src.setup.setup_athena_tables
```

Verify the tables were created:

```bash
aws athena start-query-execution \
  --query-string "SHOW TABLES IN fraud_detection" \
  --result-configuration "OutputLocation=s3://${DATA_S3_BUCKET}/athena-results/" \
  --region ${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}
```

Expected tables: `training_data`, `inference_responses`, `ground_truth`, `ground_truth_updates`, `drifted_data`

#### If both S3 upload and Athena setup failed

Run the full setup sequence:

```bash
cd ~/sample-mlops-bestpractices/sagemaker-automated-drift-and-trend-monitoring

# Install dependencies
pip install .

# Generate and upload data
python data/generate_datasets.py
mv data/generated_creditcard_predictions_final.csv data/creditcard_predictions_final.csv
mv data/generated_creditcard_drifted.csv data/creditcard_drifted.csv
mv data/generated_creditcard_ground_truth.csv data/creditcard_ground_truth.csv
python -m src.setup.upload_data_to_s3

# Create Athena tables
python -m src.setup.setup_athena_tables
```

---

### Step 1: Verify Environment Configuration

Your environment is automatically configured by the CloudFormation lifecycle script. Verify in a notebook:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
print(f"Region: {os.getenv('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION')}")
print(f"Exec Role: {os.getenv('SAGEMAKER_EXEC_ROLE')}")
print(f"MLflow URI: {os.getenv('MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI')}")
print(f"S3 Bucket: {os.getenv('DATA_S3_BUCKET')}")
```

If any values are missing, check the `.env` file was created correctly by the lifecycle script. The expected values come from the CloudFormation stack outputs.

### Steps 1-5: Training Pipeline (`1_training_pipeline.ipynb`)

**Step 1 - Data Ingestion**
- S3 data loaded into Training Data table
- The repository provides scripts to generate the training dataset (`generate_datasets.py`) if you would like to test with the sample dataset
- Alternatively, you can replace `training_data` with your own dataset

**Step 2 - Feature Engineering**
- PySpark processing transforms raw data into features
- Handles missing values, derives velocity scores, time-based features

**Step 3 - Model Training**
- XGBoost training on preprocessed features
- Hyperparameters configured in pipeline definition

**Step 4 - Model Evaluation & Registration**
- Training steps and evaluation steps log to SageMaker AI MLflow App
- Unified experiment tracking and drift computation environment
- Model registered with versioning and metadata

**Step 5 - Model Deployment**
- Custom handler deployed to SageMaker AI inference endpoint
- Once deployed, the inference handler writes all inferences to SQS and Lambda
- All notebooks include convenience script invocations for role creation and infrastructure setup (SQS, Lambda, roles, etc.)

### Steps 6-10: Inference Monitoring (`2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`)

**Step 6 - Real-Time Inference Logging**
- Endpoint logs predictions to SQS → Lambda → Athena `inference_responses` table
- Async logging with zero latency impact

**Step 7 - Ground Truth Collection** (Optional for testing)
- Simulate ground truth to test data and model drift detection
- In production, fraud confirmations arrive from investigation teams

**Step 8 - Ground Truth Backfill**
- Merge ground truth with inference responses
- Reconcile actual fraud outcomes with predictions based on `inference_id`
- Athena MERGE operation on Iceberg table (ACID compatible)

**Step 9 - Scheduled Drift Detection**
- EventBridge triggers Lambda drift monitor (daily 2 AM UTC)
- Compares training data (baseline) vs inference responses (current data)
- Runs Evidently AI drift analysis (PSI, KS tests)

**Step 10 - Drift Report Generation**
- `lambda_drift_monitor` uses Evidently to generate interactive charts
- Reports logged to SageMaker AI MLflow App
- Drift monitor checks thresholds and triggers alarms if exceeded
- Results pushed to SQS → Lambda writer → `monitoring_responses` table

### Step 11: Governance Dashboard (`3_governance_dashboard.ipynb`)

**Step 11 - QuickSight Visualization**
- Create feature drift datasets, drift scores, and severity visualizations
- Observe trends for feature drift, model drift, and data drift
- Dashboard queries Athena tables directly (inference_responses, monitoring_responses)
- Auto-refresh via EventBridge + Lambda (3 AM UTC daily)

### Model Explainability: SHAP Analysis (`6_shap_explainability.ipynb`)

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** provides mathematical explanations for individual model predictions using game theory. This notebook generates:

- **Global Feature Importance**: Which features drive fraud predictions across all samples
- **Individual Explanations**: Why a specific transaction was flagged as fraud or approved
- **Feature Interactions**: How features combine to influence predictions

**Key Insights from Analysis**:

- **Top 3 Fraud Indicators**: Account age (0.365), transaction velocity (0.294), online transactions (0.248)
- **Trust Signals**: Established accounts (>180 days), normal velocity, recurring patterns
- **Business Rules**: Apply stricter checks for new accounts and high-velocity transactions

# Introduction

Machine learning models in production degrade silently. Feature distributions shift, fraud patterns evolve, and by the time business metrics reveal the problem, the damage is done. Most teams invest heavily in training pipelines but leave inference monitoring as an afterthought — relying on expensive managed platforms or discovering issues through customer complaints.

This solution provides an end-to-end, open-source MLOps system built on Amazon SageMaker, MLflow, and Evidently AI that closes the ML governance gap. It trains an XGBoost fraud detection model via SageMaker Pipelines, logs every prediction to an Athena Iceberg data lake with zero-latency async writes, and runs automated daily drift checks using EventBridge-triggered Lambda functions. Evidently AI generates interactive data drift and classification reports, while configurable thresholds in a central `config.yaml` let teams tune sensitivity for both data and model drift without code changes. SNS alerts fire when drift exceeds thresholds, and an Amazon QuickSight governance dashboard — refreshed automatically via a dedicated EventBridge + Lambda pipeline — surfaces inference trends, drift history, and model performance in a single pane of glass.

The result is a production-ready monitoring system with pay-as-you-go pricing that scales linearly with inference volume, runs entirely on open-source SDKs portable across clouds, and handles real-world challenges like delayed ground truth confirmations, concept drift, and multi-feature drift analysis. Three guided Jupyter notebooks walk you from training through monitoring to dashboard creation, making it straightforward to adapt this pattern to your own models and datasets.

**Understanding Drift Through Visualization**

The QuickSight governance dashboard features drift score trendlines that plot each feature's Population Stability Index (PSI) over time. These time-series visualizations let you identify which specific features are drifting (e.g., `credit_limit` spiking to 74.47, `merchant_category_code` at 28.25), distinguish temporary spikes from permanent shifts, and correlate drift events with model deployments or business changes. Instead of a single "drift detected" alert, you get granular per-feature analysis showing exactly which input distributions have changed since training — enabling targeted investigation of data quality issues, pipeline changes, or genuine shifts in customer behavior. For an accessible deep dive into interpreting drift scores and PSI calculations, see [Understanding Drift Scores: A Visual Guide](docs/screenshots/quicksight/README.md). To extend your dashboard with additional feature-level drift visuals (timelines, top drifting features, severity distributions), see [Feature-Level Drift Analysis Implementation Guide](docs/screenshots/quicksight/FEATURE_LEVEL_SUMMARY.md).

# Credit Card Fraud Detection with SageMaker Pipelines

Production-grade ML pipeline for credit card fraud detection using AWS SageMaker Pipelines, MLflow tracking, and Athena data lake integration with comprehensive inference monitoring and drift detection.


**Why This Project Matters**

Machine learning models degrade over time. Production models face data drift (feature distributions change), concept drift (prediction-target relationships shift), and performance degradation as the real world evolves. Without continuous monitoring, ML systems fail silently — making increasingly poor decisions while appearing healthy on dashboards. 

This solution addresses a critical gap: **lack of production-ready inference monitoring options** in the ML ecosystem. While training pipelines are well-served by managed platforms, comprehensive inference monitoring with drift detection, ground truth integration, and automated alerting requires custom solutions or expensive enterprise platforms.

This is especially critical for fraud detection, where:
- **Fraudsters adapt**: Attack patterns evolve to evade detection
- **Customer behavior shifts**: Economic conditions, seasonal trends, new payment methods
- **Delayed ground truth**: Fraud confirmation takes days or weeks, making real-time accuracy impossible to measure
- **High stakes**: False positives annoy customers, false negatives cost money

**The ML Governance Gap**

Most organizations have robust training pipelines but lack production inference monitoring. They deploy models and hope for the best. When performance degrades, they discover it through business metrics (customer complaints, financial losses) rather than automated alerts. By then, damage is done.

Existing solutions are inadequate:
- **Managed platforms** require significant upfront licensing fees and lock you into proprietary systems
- **Built-in monitoring tools** often lack integration with open-source drift detection libraries and have limited serverless endpoint support
- **Custom solutions** require months of engineering effort to build drift detection, ground truth integration, and alerting

**This Project's Solution**

A ** Open-source MLOps system** that establishes automated monitoring and governance for ML inference:

- **Training Pipeline:** SageMaker Pipelines with automated preprocessing, training (XGBoost), evaluation, and deployment
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow for model versioning, metrics, and artifact management
- **Data Lake:** Athena Iceberg tables for training data and inference logging
- **Custom Inference Handler:** Automatic logging of all predictions with buffered async writes (zero latency impact)
- **Monitoring & Drift Detection:** Continuous model performance tracking with Evidently-powered interactive reports, automated daily checks, and SNS email alerts
- **Ground Truth Integration:** Asynchronous ground truth capture with Athena MERGE updates for delayed fraud confirmations
- **Governance Dashboard:** QuickSight dashboard with automated daily refresh showing inference trends, drift history, and model performance

**Key Benefits:**
- **Cost Efficient:** Pay-as-you-go serverless architecture scales to zero when idle. Variable costs (inference invocations, Athena queries, Lambda executions) scale linearly with traffic, while fixed costs (S3 storage, MLflow tracking) remain minimal and predictable. No upfront licensing fees or reserved capacity required.
- **Portable:** Open-source SDKs (MLflow, Evidently, Pandas) run anywhere — AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem
- **Production Ready:** Handles real-world ML challenges (delayed ground truth, data drift, concept drift, alerting)
- **Automated:** EventBridge schedules drift checks at 2 AM, QuickSight refreshes at 3 AM — no manual intervention
- **Comprehensive:** Training, inference, monitoring, drift detection, and governance in one integrated system

## Inference Monitoring Process Flow

![Inference Monitoring Process Flow](docs/guides/inference_monitoring_processflow.png)

> **Detailed Flow**: This diagram shows the complete inference monitoring pipeline from real-time predictions through ground truth backfill, drift detection, and governance visualization. Each data flow is numbered and labeled for clarity.

This detailed diagram shows the **end-to-end inference monitoring flow** with MLflow as the central monitoring interface:

### Flow Breakdown:

**1. Real-Time Inference (Top)**
- Application sends transaction with 30 features → SageMaker Endpoint
- Endpoint runs XGBoost model, returns prediction + fraud probability
- Zero latency added to inference (async logging happens in background)

**2. Async Logging Pipeline**
- Inference handler sends prediction to SQS queue (fire-and-forget)
- Lambda consumer batches messages (10 msgs or 30s window)
- Writes batch to Athena inference_responses table
- **Partitioned by date** for efficient querying

**3. Ground Truth Integration**
- Fraud investigations confirm actual fraud (days/weeks later)
- Updates flow to ground_truth_updates table
- Athena MERGE updates inference_responses with confirmed labels
- Enables model performance tracking with real outcomes

**4. MLflow Monitoring Interface (Central Hub)**
MLflow serves as the **unified monitoring dashboard** where all monitoring workflows converge:

**Metrics Logged:**
- **Data Drift**: `drifted_columns_count`, `drifted_columns_share`, per-feature `drift_score_*` (via Evidently DataDriftPreset)
- **Model Performance**: `current_roc_auc`, `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, plus Evidently classification metrics (`evidently_accuracy`, `evidently_f1`, etc.)
- **Degradation**: `roc_auc_degradation`, `roc_auc_degradation_pct`
- **Detection Flags**: `data_drift_detected`, `model_drift_detected`

**Visualizations (artifacts/evidently_reports/):**
- Interactive Evidently HTML data drift report (PSI, KS, distribution comparisons per feature)
- Interactive Evidently HTML classification report (ROC curve, PR curve, confusion matrix, accuracy, F1)

**Artifacts:**
- `evidently_reports/data_drift_*.html` - Full interactive data drift dashboard
- `evidently_reports/classification_*.html` - Full interactive classification dashboard
- `drift_reports/drift_summary_*.json` - Structured JSON drift summary

**5. Monitoring Workflows**
- **Manual**: Data scientists run `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` → query Athena → run Evidently reports → log interactive HTML reports to MLflow
- **Automated**: EventBridge triggers Lambda daily → runs Evidently DataDriftPreset + ClassificationPreset → logs HTML reports & metrics to MLflow → sends SNS alert if drift detected

**6. Alerting**
- SNS sends email notifications when thresholds exceeded
- Includes drifted features, performance metrics, and actionable recommendations
- Email contains links to MLflow for detailed analysis

### Key Differentiators:

✅ **MLflow as Single Pane of Glass** - All monitoring metrics, Evidently HTML reports, and artifacts in one interface
✅ **Evidently-Powered Drift Detection** - Interactive HTML reports with PSI, KS, distribution comparisons per feature
✅ **Automated + Manual** - Both notebook-based exploration and scheduled Lambda checks
✅ **Ground Truth Integration** - Handles delayed fraud confirmation typical in fraud detection
✅ **Zero Inference Latency** - Async logging doesn't impact prediction response time
✅ **Cost-Efficient** - $5/month Lambda + $25/month Athena vs. $200+/month for SageMaker Model Monitor


**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Open-Source SDKs (MLflow, Evidently, Pandas, Scikit-learn)** - Ensures portability across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem. No vendor lock-in. Industry-standard tools = easier hiring.

2. **Cost Efficiency** - Serverless architecture scales to zero when idle, charging only for actual usage rather than reserved capacity. Variable costs (inference invocations, Athena queries, Lambda executions) scale linearly with traffic. Fixed costs (S3 storage, MLflow tracking) remain minimal. No upfront licensing or minimum commitments required.

3. **Custom Inference Monitoring** - Evidently-powered drift detection (DataDriftPreset for all features, ClassificationPreset for model performance), automated ground truth integration, and EventBridge/Lambda alerting with interactive HTML reports logged to MLflow. Most platforms lack comprehensive inference monitoring or charge premium rates.

4. **Production-Grade Without Platform Costs** - SageMaker provides reliability (99.9% SLA) while MLflow provides portability. Best of both worlds: enterprise reliability + startup agility.

**vs. Alternatives:** This solution balances pay-as-you-go pricing, portability, and operational simplicity. Fully managed platforms require significant upfront licensing and vendor lock-in. Pure cloud-native solutions lack portability. Open-source platforms are portable but require substantial DevOps investment. This architecture delivers enterprise reliability with startup agility.

**Ideal For:** Teams needing production ML with comprehensive monitoring, audit trails, and multi-cloud optionality without enterprise platform licensing costs or operational complexity.

## Why Not SageMaker DataCaptureConfig?

SageMaker provides a built-in [`DataCaptureConfig`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-data-capture.html) that captures raw request/response payloads from real-time endpoints and writes them to S3 in jsonl format. But it only supports real-time endpoints as of today.

`DataCaptureConfig` makes sense if you are using real-time endpoints. For this architecture — which prioritizes Evidently-powered drift detection, MLflow as the monitoring hub, Athena as the data lake, and cost efficiency — a custom SQS→Lambda→Athena pipeline is the better fit.

## Architecture Diagrams

The main architecture diagrams are:
- **MetaMonitoring.png** — 11-step end-to-end MLOps pipeline (hand-built in Excalidraw)
- **inference_monitoring_processflow.png** — 13-step detailed monitoring flow (hand-built in Excalidraw)

Editable source files:
- `docs/guides/architecture_diagram.excalidraw` — Open at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)
- `docs/inference_monitoring_flow.excalidraw` — Generated programmatically, editable in Excalidraw

### Legacy Diagram Generation

Previous programmatically-generated diagrams (now superseded by hand-built versions) can be regenerated:

```bash
pip install diagrams
brew install graphviz  # macOS

python docs/generate_architecture_diagram.py
python docs/generate_inference_monitoring_diagram.py
python docs/generate_mlflow_evidently_diagram.py
```

## CloudFormation Stack Management

For full details on deploying, updating, and deleting the stack — including parameter reference, troubleshooting, and cost notes — see **[`cloudformation/README.md`](cloudformation/README.md)**.


## Quick Start

After deploying the CloudFormation stack and running the JupyterLab space (see [Setup: Deploy with CloudFormation](#setup-deploy-with-cloudformation)), the environment is ready to use. The lifecycle script has already:

- Cloned the repository
- Generated synthetic datasets and uploaded them to S3
- Created the Athena database and Iceberg tables
- Written a populated `.env` file

### CloudWatch Permissions (for Drift Monitoring Dashboard & Alarms)

The CloudFormation execution role **automatically includes** CloudWatch Metrics/Alarms/Dashboards permissions via the `${ProjectName}-CloudWatchMetricsAccess` inline policy. No manual action is required for standard deployments.

> **If using `UseExistingRole=true`:** Your existing role must include the following permissions for Cell 40 in `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` to work (publish custom metrics, create alarms, and build dashboards):
>
> ```json
> {
>   "Version": "2012-10-17",
>   "Statement": [
>     {
>       "Effect": "Allow",
>       "Action": [
>         "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
>         "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm",
>         "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms",
>         "cloudwatch:PutDashboard",
>         "cloudwatch:GetDashboard",
>         "cloudwatch:ListDashboards"
>       ],
>       "Resource": "*"
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```

### SQS + Lambda Inference Logging (Auto-Provisioned)

The CloudFormation stack **automatically provisions** the SQS queue (`${ProjectName}-inference-logging`), Lambda inference logger (`${ProjectName}-inference-logger`), and event source mapping (batch size 10, 30s window). The `.env` file is pre-populated with `SQS_URL`, `SQS_QUEUE_NAME`, and `LAMBDA_LOGGER_NAME`. No manual action is required for standard deployments.

> **If not using CloudFormation:** Run `uv run main.py setup-logging` manually, then update `SQS_URL` in `.env` with the created queue URL.

### Run Complete Pipeline

**Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)**

```bash
# In SageMaker Studio, open:
notebooks/1_training_pipeline.ipynb

# Run cells sequentially:
# Cell 1-3: Setup and configuration
# Cell 4: Create/update pipeline definition
# Cell 5: Execute pipeline and wait for completion (~25 minutes)
```

**Option 2: CLI**

```bash
# Create pipeline
python main.py pipeline create --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline

# Execute pipeline
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline --wait

# Check status
python main.py pipeline status --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
```

### Test Inference & Monitoring

```bash
# 1. Open monitoring notebook
# notebooks/2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb

# 2. Run inference tests (Cells 1-9 in the notebook)
# Or via CLI:
# uv run main.py test --endpoint-name fraud-detector-endpoint --num-samples 50

# 3. Simulate ground truth (for development/testing)
python -m src.monitoring.simulate_ground_truth_from_athena --accuracy 0.85

# 4. Apply ground truth updates
python -m src.monitoring.update_ground_truth --mode batch

# 5. Run monitoring & drift detection (Cells 27-40 in 2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb)
# Generates 8+ charts, calculates metrics, detects drift
```

**Expected Output:**
- Predictions logged to Athena automatically
- 100% ground truth coverage (simulated)
- Performance metrics: ROC-AUC, precision, recall
- Drift detection with visualizations
- 8 charts uploaded to MLflow

## Custom Inference Handler

### Why a Custom Handler?

The pipeline deploys models with a **custom inference handler** instead of SageMaker's built-in XGBoost serving:

| Feature | Built-in XGBoost | Custom Handler |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Predictions | ✅ | ✅ |
| Input Format | CSV, libsvm | JSON (extensible) |
| Output Format | Single probability | Detailed predictions + probabilities |
| **Athena Logging** | ❌ Manual | ✅ **Automatic** |
| MLflow Integration | ❌ | ✅ |
| Performance Metrics | ❌ | ✅ Latency, confidence |
| Monitoring Flags | ❌ | ✅ High/low confidence detection |
| Production-Ready | ⚠️ Simple use cases | ✅ Enterprise-grade |

### Key Features

#### 1. Automatic Athena Logging

Every inference request is logged with:
- Prediction metadata: inference_id, timestamp, prediction, probabilities
- Performance: latency (total, preprocessing, model), confidence scores
- Transaction context: transaction_id, amount, customer_id
- Model info: endpoint_name, model_version, mlflow_run_id

#### 2. SQS + Lambda Async Writes

Inference logs are written asynchronously via SQS to avoid impacting prediction latency:

```
Custom Handler → SQS (fire-and-forget, per prediction)
                   ↓
              SQS batches messages (10 msgs or 30s window)
                   ↓
              Lambda triggered (lambda_inference_logger.py)
                   ↓
              INSERT INTO fraud_detection.inference_responses
```

- **Zero latency impact** — SQS `send_message` is fire-and-forget in the inference handler
- **Batched writes** — Lambda receives up to 10 SQS records per invocation
- **Athena INSERT** — Lambda builds a multi-row `INSERT INTO` statement and executes via Athena
- **Graceful failure** — SQS retains messages for 24 hours if Lambda fails

#### 3. JSON Input/Output Format

**Request (30 features):**
```json
{
  "transaction_hour": 14,
  "transaction_day_of_week": 2,
  "transaction_amount": 149.62,
  "customer_age": 42,
  "customer_gender": 0,
  "distance_from_home_km": 5.2,
  "merchant_category_code": 5411,
  "chip_transaction": 1,
  "num_transactions_24h": 3,
  "credit_limit": 5000.0,
  "available_credit_ratio": 0.75
  // ... (all 30 training features)
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "predictions": [0],
  "probabilities": {
    "fraud": [0.1234],
    "non_fraud": [0.8766]
  }
}
```

### Testing in SageMaker Studio Endpoint Playground

After deployment, you can test the endpoint directly in SageMaker Studio without writing code.

**Access Path:**
```
SageMaker Studio > Deployments > Endpoints > Fraud Detector Endpoint > Playground
```

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to endpoint:**
   - Open SageMaker Studio
   - Left sidebar: Deployments → Endpoints
   - Click on `fraud-detector-endpoint`
   - Click "Playground" tab

2. **Configure request:**
   - Content-Type: `application/json`
   - Request body: Paste JSON payload with 30 features

3. **Example payload:**
   ```json
   {
     "transaction_hour": 14,
     "transaction_day_of_week": 2,
     "transaction_amount": 149.62,
     "transaction_type_code": 1,
     "customer_age": 42,
     "customer_gender": 0,
     "customer_tenure_months": 36,
     "account_age_days": 1095,
     "distance_from_home_km": 5.2,
     "distance_from_last_transaction_km": 2.3,
     "time_since_last_transaction_min": 120,
     "online_transaction": 1,
     "international_transaction": 0,
     "high_risk_country": 0,
     "merchant_category_code": 5411,
     "merchant_reputation_score": 0.85,

     "pin_used": 1,
     "card_present": 1,
     "cvv_match": 1,
     "address_verification_match": 1,
     "num_transactions_24h": 3,
     "num_transactions_7days": 12,
     "avg_transaction_amount_30days": 125.50,
     "max_transaction_amount_30days": 450.00,
     "velocity_score": 0.3,
     "recurring_transaction": 0,
     "previous_fraud_incidents": 0,
     "credit_limit": 5000.0,
     "available_credit_ratio": 0.75
   }
   ```

4. **Click "Test"**

5. **Expected response:**
   ```json
   {
     "predictions": [0],
     "probabilities": {
       "fraud": [0.1234],
       "non_fraud": [0.8766]
     }
   }
   ```

**Screenshot:** See `docs/screenshots/DirectTestingInSGPlayground-custom-handler.png` for visual guide

**When to use:**
- Quick manual testing without code
- Debugging endpoint issues
- Demonstrating to stakeholders
- Validating deployment after pipeline execution
- Generating sample payloads for documentation

**Note:** The playground sends requests to your deployed endpoint, so predictions will be automatically logged to Athena (custom handler feature).

### Implementation Location

- **Inference Handler (SQS):** `src/train_pipeline/pipeline_steps/inference.py` — sends each prediction to SQS
- **Lambda Consumer:** `lambda_inference_logger.py` — reads SQS batches, writes to Athena
- **Setup Script:** `src/setup/setup_inference_logging.py` — creates SQS queue + Lambda + event source mapping
- **Legacy Handler (Direct Athena):** `src/train_pipeline/inference_handler.py` — buffered awswrangler writes (alternative)
- **Dependencies:** `src/train_pipeline/inference_requirements.txt`
- **Pipeline Integration:** `src/train_pipeline/pipeline.py`

**How it works (SQS path):**
```python
# In the inference handler (predict_fn)
sqs.send_message(
    QueueUrl=SQS_QUEUE_URL,
    MessageBody=json.dumps({
        'inference_id': str(uuid.uuid4()),
        'request_timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        'prediction': int(predictions[idx]),
        'probability_fraud': fraud_prob,
        # ... 22 more fields
    }),
)

# Lambda consumer (lambda_inference_logger.py)
# Triggered by SQS with batch of up to 10 messages
# Builds: INSERT INTO fraud_detection.inference_responses VALUES (row1), (row2), ...
# Executes via athena.start_query_execution()
```

## SageMaker Pipeline Workflow

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Preprocess** - Read from Athena, validate, encode categorical, split train/test (80/20)
2. **Train** - XGBoost with automatic class imbalance handling (scale_pos_weight)
3. **Evaluate** - Calculate ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix
4. **Quality Gate** - Register model only if ROC-AUC ≥ 0.85 AND PR-AUC ≥ 0.50
5. **Deploy** - Create endpoint with custom handler and Athena logging

### Create Pipeline

**Via Notebook:**
```python
# In 1_training_pipeline.ipynb Cell 4
result = pipeline_builder.upsert_pipeline(
    pipeline_name='fraud-detection-pipeline',
    pipeline_display_name='Credit Card Fraud Detection Pipeline'
)
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
python main.py pipeline create --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
```

### Execute Pipeline

**Via Notebook:**
```python
# Cell 5: Execute and wait
execution = pipeline.start()
execution.wait(delay=60, max_attempts=30)
```

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# With waiting
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline --wait

# Without waiting (monitor in console)
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
```

### Monitor Execution

**AWS Console:**
```
SageMaker → Pipelines → fraud-detection-pipeline → Executions
```

**CLI:**
```bash
# Get latest execution status
python main.py pipeline status --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline

# List all executions
python main.py pipeline list-executions --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
```

**Expected Duration:** ~25 minutes
- Preprocess: 3-5 min
- Train: 10-15 min
- Evaluate: 2-3 min
- Deploy: 5-7 min

## MLflow Integration

### Configuration

**ARN Format (Programmatic Access):**
```python
# Use ARN for SDK and pipeline access
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:mlflow-app/app-ABC123"
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)
```

```python
# In training step
mlflow.xgboost.autolog()  # Automatic parameter and metric logging

with mlflow.start_run():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # MLflow automatically logs:
    # - Hyperparameters (max_depth, learning_rate, etc.)
    # - Training metrics (logloss, error)
    # - Model artifacts
    # - Feature importance
    # - Confusion matrix
```

- `credit-card-fraud-detection-inference` - Inference monitoring
- `credit-card-fraud-detection-batch` - Batch transform jobs

### Model Registry

Models are automatically registered on successful evaluation:

```python
# In evaluation step (if ROC-AUC ≥ 0.85)
mlflow.register_model(
    model_uri=f"runs:/{run_id}/model",
    name="xgboost-fraud-detector"
)
```

**Model Versions:**
- Version 1, 2, 3... (incremented automatically)
- Stages: `None` → `Staging` → `Production` → `Archived`
- Tags: training_date, pipeline_execution_id, roc_auc, pr_auc

## Inference Monitoring & Drift Detection

### Monitoring Architecture

```
Inference (T+0) → SQS → Lambda → Athena: inference_responses (ground_truth=NULL)
                                                    ↓
Ground Truth Capture (T+1 to T+30)        → ground_truth_updates
                                                    ↓
Batch MERGE                               → inference_responses (ground_truth populated)
                                                    ↓
Monitoring                                → Calculate metrics where ground_truth IS NOT NULL
```

### Ground Truth Capture

**🔔 IMPORTANT: Production Implementation Required**

The current implementation uses **simulation for development/testing**. In production, replace with actual business processes:

**Production Sources:**
- **Fraud Investigation Systems:** Confirmed fraud cases from investigation team
- **Chargeback Notifications:** Disputed transactions from payment processors
- **Customer Complaints:** Fraud reports from customer service
- **Merchant Reports:** Suspicious activity flagged by merchants
- **Law Enforcement:** Cases confirmed by authorities

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# Example: Fraud investigation system integration
def capture_investigation_result(transaction_id, is_fraud, source):
    """
    Called when fraud investigation completes.
    Replace simulate_ground_truth_from_athena.py with this in production.
    """
    ground_truth_update = {
        'transaction_id': transaction_id,
        'inference_id': lookup_inference_id(transaction_id),
        'actual_fraud': is_fraud,
        'confirmation_timestamp': datetime.now(),
        'confirmation_source': source,  # e.g., 'fraud_investigation'
        'investigation_notes': get_investigation_notes(transaction_id)
    }

    # Write to ground_truth_updates table
    write_to_athena(ground_truth_update)
```

**Development/Testing (Current):**
```bash
# Simulates realistic ground truth with configurable accuracy
python -m src.monitoring.simulate_ground_truth_from_athena --accuracy 0.85
```

This creates realistic confirmations:
- Fraud cases: 1-7 days confirmation delay
- Non-fraud: 1-30 days confirmation delay
- Configurable accuracy (default 85%)
- Realistic confirmation sources

### Applying Ground Truth Updates

```bash
# Batch mode: Process all pending updates
python -m src.monitoring.update_ground_truth --mode batch

# Streaming mode: Process recent updates (last 24 hours)
python -m src.monitoring.update_ground_truth --mode streaming --window-hours 24
```

This performs Athena MERGE to update `ground_truth` column in `inference_responses`.

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor last 30 days
python -m src.monitoring.monitor_model_performance --days 30

# With custom alert threshold
python -m src.monitoring.monitor_model_performance \
  --days 30 \
  --alert-threshold 0.80 \
  --endpoint fraud-detector-prod
```

**Output:**
```
Ground Truth Coverage:
  Total predictions: 50,000
  With ground truth: 12,500 (25.00%)
  Avg days to confirmation: 8.5

Overall Performance (last 30 days):
  ROC-AUC: 0.8742
  PR-AUC: 0.6521
  Precision: 0.7245
  Recall: 0.6891
  F1-Score: 0.7063

✓ No performance degradation detected
```

### Drift Detection Methods

All drift detection is powered by [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/) (v0.7.x). The notebook and Lambda both use `evidently_reports.py` which wraps Evidently's `DataDriftPreset` and `ClassificationPreset`.

#### Data Drift (Feature Distribution Changes)

Evidently's `DataDriftPreset` automatically selects the appropriate statistical test per feature (KS for numeric, chi-square for categorical) and computes drift scores. The interactive HTML report includes per-feature distribution comparisons, PSI values, and statistical test results.

**Legacy reference:** The `calculate_psi()` and `calculate_ks_statistic()` functions in `lambda_drift_monitor.py` are preserved as legacy examples showing how to compute these metrics manually without Evidently.

**Population Stability Index (PSI):**

PSI measures how much a feature's distribution has shifted between the baseline (training) period and the current (inference) period.

**Formula:**

```
PSI = Σ (actual_pct_i - expected_pct_i) × ln(actual_pct_i / expected_pct_i)
```

Where `expected_pct_i` and `actual_pct_i` are the proportion of observations in bin `i` for the baseline and current distributions, respectively.

**How it's computed** (see `inference_monitoring.py:86-124`):

1. Create bin edges from the baseline (training) data using percentile-based breakpoints (10 bins by default)
2. Histogram both baseline and current data into the same bins
3. Normalize each histogram to proportions (percentage of total in each bin)
4. Apply a floor of `0.0001` to avoid `ln(0)` or division by zero
5. Sum the PSI contribution from each bin: `(actual% - expected%) × ln(actual% / expected%)`

**Interpretation thresholds:**

| PSI Value | Interpretation | Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| < 0.1     | No significant shift | None |
| 0.1 – 0.2 | Moderate shift | Monitor closely |
| ≥ 0.2     | Significant shift | Investigate / retrain |

**Avg PSI (Population-Level Drift Score):**

`Avg PSI` is the **simple arithmetic mean of per-feature PSI values** across all monitored features. It provides a single scalar summarizing overall dataset drift.

```python
# From detect_data_drift() → summary
avg_psi = mean(psi_feature_1, psi_feature_2, ..., psi_feature_N)
```

This metric is logged to MLflow as `drift_avg_psi` alongside `drift_max_psi` and `drift_median_psi`.

A feature is flagged as drifted if **either** its PSI ≥ 0.2 **or** its KS test p-value < 0.05.

**Feature Extraction for Drift Detection:**

The drift detection process (Cell 31 in `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`) analyzes **all 30 training features** by parsing the `input_features` JSON column:

```python
import json

# Parse JSON to extract all features from inference data
feature_rows = []
for idx, row in inference_raw.iterrows():
    try:
        # Parse the input_features JSON string
        features_dict = json.loads(row['input_features'])

        # Extract exactly the 30 training features
        feature_values = {feat: features_dict.get(feat, np.nan) for feat in TRAINING_FEATURES}
        feature_rows.append(feature_values)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'  ⚠ Failed to parse row {idx}: {e}')
        continue

# Create DataFrame with all 30 features
inference_numeric = pd.DataFrame(feature_rows)

# Run drift detection on ALL features
drift_results = detect_data_drift(
    baseline_data=baseline_numeric[common_features],  # 284K rows × 30 features
    current_data=inference_numeric,                   # Inference rows × 30 features
    feature_names=common_features,                    # All 30 features
    threshold_psi=0.2,
    threshold_ks=0.05,
)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
================================================================================
DATA DRIFT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================
  Total features analyzed: 30          ← All features extracted from JSON
  Drifted features: 5
  Drift percentage: 16.7%
  Avg PSI: 0.0842
  Max PSI: 0.2145

⚠ DRIFTED FEATURES (5):
================================================================================
  🔴 CRITICAL transaction_amount: PSI=0.2145
  🟠 MODERATE customer_age: PSI=0.1523
  🟠 MODERATE distance_from_home_km: PSI=0.1205
  🟡 MINOR online_transaction: PSI=0.0923
  🟡 MINOR merchant_reputation_score: PSI=0.0812
```

**Chi-Square Test:**
```python
# For categorical features
chi2_stat, p_value = chi2_test(reference_counts, current_counts)

# Alert if p_value < 0.05 (distribution changed significantly)
```

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test:**
```python
# For continuous feature distributions
ks_stat, p_value = ks_test(reference_values, current_values)

# Alert if p_value < 0.05
```

#### Statistical Tests: KS vs Wasserstein (Configuration Guide)

This project uses **Evidently** for advanced drift detection with configurable statistical tests. For **fraud detection**, we default to the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test** over Wasserstein distance.

##### Why KS Test for Fraud Detection?

**KS Test Advantages:**
- **Tail Sensitivity ⭐** - Detects maximum difference in CDFs, crucial for catching rare fraud pattern changes
- **Statistical Significance** - Returns p-value (e.g., p < 0.05 = 95% confidence), helps distinguish real drift from noise
- **Distribution-Free** - No assumptions about underlying distributions (robust to non-normal data)
- **Shape Detection** - Catches changes in distribution shape, not just location/scale shifts
- **Interpretable** - KS statistic = max vertical distance between CDFs (0-1 scale)

**Why Not Wasserstein?**
- **Less Tail-Sensitive** - Can miss subtle changes in extreme values (where fraud patterns emerge)
- **No P-Value** - Harder to set universal thresholds across different features
- **Mean-Focused** - Better for overall distribution shifts than detecting new fraud tactics
- **Computationally Heavier** - O(n log n) vs O(n) for KS test

**Real-World Example:**
```
Scenario: New fraud ring targeting $500-$600 transactions

Baseline:  Transactions spread $0-$1000 (normal distribution)
Current:   Slight spike at $500-600 (2% of transactions)

Wasserstein: 0.08 (small overall shift, might not alert)
KS Test:     0.15, p=0.001 (significant tail change, alerts)
```

For fraud detection, **catching rare pattern changes early** (KS strength) is more critical than measuring overall distribution distance (Wasserstein strength).

##### Configuration

Configure the statistical test in `.env`:

```bash
# Statistical test for numerical features
# Options: 'ks' (default), 'wasserstein', 'kl_div', 'psi', 'jensenshannon'
EVIDENTLY_NUM_STAT_TEST=ks

# KS test thresholds
KS_DRIFT_THRESHOLD=0.1          # Moderate drift threshold
KS_PVALUE_THRESHOLD=0.05        # Statistical significance (95% confidence)
KS_ENABLE_CDF_PLOTS=true        # Generate CDF comparison visualizations
KS_MAX_FEATURES_TO_PLOT=10      # Top N drifted features to visualize

# Categorical feature test (unchanged)
EVIDENTLY_CAT_STAT_TEST=chi_square
```

**Configuration in Code:**
```python
# src/config/config.py (lines 202-210)
EVIDENTLY_NUM_STAT_TEST = os.getenv('EVIDENTLY_NUM_STAT_TEST', 'ks')
KS_DRIFT_THRESHOLD = float(os.getenv('KS_DRIFT_THRESHOLD', '0.1'))
KS_PVALUE_THRESHOLD = float(os.getenv('KS_PVALUE_THRESHOLD', '0.05'))
```

##### KS-Specific Visualizations

When KS test is enabled (`EVIDENTLY_NUM_STAT_TEST=ks`), additional visualizations are generated:

**1. CDF Comparison Plots** - Shows empirical CDFs for baseline vs current distributions with maximum KS distance marked

**2. KS Statistics Heatmap** - Two-panel visualization:
   - Left: KS statistic bars (0-1 scale, color-coded by severity)
   - Right: -log10(p-value) bars (statistical significance)

**3. Enhanced MLflow Metrics:**
```python
# Aggregated KS metrics
ks_mean_ks_statistic
ks_max_ks_statistic
ks_median_ks_statistic
ks_features_moderate_drift    # 0.1 ≤ KS < 0.2
ks_features_high_drift        # KS ≥ 0.2
ks_features_significant       # p-value < 0.05
```

##### Dual-Threshold Alerting

The KS test uses **both** the KS statistic and p-value for robust drift detection:

```python
# Drift detection logic
if ks_stat > 0.2 and p_value < 0.05:
    severity = "CRITICAL"    # Immediate investigation
elif ks_stat > 0.1 and p_value < 0.05:
    severity = "MODERATE"    # Monitor closely
elif ks_stat > 0.1 or p_value < 0.05:
    severity = "WARNING"     # Single threshold met
else:
    severity = "NORMAL"
```

This dual-threshold approach reduces false positives while maintaining high sensitivity to real drift.

##### Switching to Wasserstein (If Needed)

To use Wasserstein distance instead:

```bash
# In .env
EVIDENTLY_NUM_STAT_TEST=wasserstein
EVIDENTLY_DRIFT_THRESHOLD=0.2    # Overall drift threshold
```

**When to use Wasserstein:**
- General ML pipelines (non-fraud use cases)
- Measuring overall distribution distance
- When p-values are not required
- Benchmarking against academic papers using EMD

**Best Practice:** Monitor **both** metrics and compare. If both spike → high confidence drift. If only KS spikes → investigate tail changes.

#### Concept Drift (Prediction-Target Relationship Changes)

**Metrics Tracked:**
- ROC-AUC degradation (alert if drops > 5%)
- Precision/Recall changes
- False positive rate increase
- False negative rate increase
- High confidence error rate

### Baseline Data for Drift Detection

Drift detection compares current inference feature distributions against a **baseline**. The baseline should represent the data the model was trained on.

**Current approach** (`2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`):
```python
baseline_df = pd.read_csv(CSV_TRAINING_DATA)
```

This loads the CSV file directly from disk. Since the same data has already been migrated to the Athena `training_data` table (via `main.py setup --migrate-data`), the baseline can alternatively be loaded from Athena using PySpark or boto3:

**Option 1: PySpark (for large-scale processing):**
```python
from athena.athena_client_pyspark import AthenaClientPySpark

client = AthenaClientPySpark(database="fraud_detection")
baseline_spark_df = client.read_table("training_data")
baseline_df = baseline_spark_df.toPandas()  # Convert to pandas for drift analysis
```

**Option 2: Boto3 + Pandas (for monitoring/small queries):**
```python
import boto3
import pandas as pd
import io
import time

def read_athena_query(sql, database, output_location):
    """Execute Athena query and return pandas DataFrame."""
    athena = boto3.client('athena')
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Start query execution
    response = athena.start_query_execution(
        QueryString=sql,
        QueryExecutionContext={'Database': database},
        ResultConfiguration={'OutputLocation': output_location}
    )
    execution_id = response['QueryExecutionId']

    # Wait for completion
    while True:
        status = athena.get_query_execution(QueryExecutionId=execution_id)
        state = status['QueryExecution']['Status']['State']
        if state in ['SUCCEEDED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED']:
            break
        time.sleep(1)

    if state != 'SUCCEEDED':
        raise Exception(f"Query failed: {state}")

    # Download results from S3
    result_s3_path = status['QueryExecution']['ResultConfiguration']['OutputLocation']
    bucket, key = result_s3_path.replace("s3://", "").split("/", 1)
    obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)

    return pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(obj['Body'].read()))

# Usage
baseline_df = read_athena_query(
    sql="SELECT * FROM training_data LIMIT 10000",
    database="fraud_detection",
    output_location="s3://your-bucket/athena-results/"
)
```

**Why use the Athena `training_data` table as baseline:**
- **Single source of truth** — the same table the training pipeline reads from, so schema and column types are guaranteed to match
- **No local file dependency** — works in any SageMaker environment without needing the CSV on disk
- **Consistent with pipeline** — the preprocessing step reads from `training_data` via PySpark, so monitoring and training reference the same data
- **Versioned via Iceberg** — if the training data is updated (new features, augmented samples), the Athena table reflects that without needing to re-distribute CSV files

**Note:** For the current PoC, CSV loading is sufficient. In production, the Athena table is the preferred source since it stays in sync with whatever the training pipeline consumes. **awswrangler has been deprecated** in favor of PySpark (for large-scale processing) and boto3 (for monitoring queries).

## Automated Drift Monitoring

**NEW**: Automated drift detection with EventBridge, Lambda, and SNS email alerts.

### Overview

The system automatically monitors for data drift and model performance drift, sending email alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

**Architecture:**
```
EventBridge Rule → Lambda Function → SNS Topic → Email
(daily at 2am)     (drift detection)   (alerts)     (ops team)
                         ↓
                  Athena Data Lake
                (inference_responses)
```

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Using Notebook (Recommended)**
1. Open `notebooks/2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`
2. Navigate to **Section 6: Automated Drift Monitoring Setup**
3. Run cells 6.1-6.3 to deploy infrastructure
4. Confirm email subscription

**Option 2: Using CI/CD Script**
```bash
export ALERT_EMAIL="ops@example.com"
export ATHENA_DATABASE="fraud_detection"
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
export ATHENA_OUTPUT_S3="s3://fraud-detection-data-lake-skoppar-${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/athena-query-results/"

### Thresholds Explained

**Data Drift (PSI Thresholds):**

| PSI Value | Interpretation | Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| < 0.1 | No significant shift | None |
| 0.1 - 0.2 | Moderate shift | Monitor closely |
| ≥ 0.2 | Significant shift | **Alert triggered** |

**Model Drift (Performance Degradation):**

| Degradation | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| < 3% | Normal variance | None |
| 3-5% | Minor degradation | Monitor |
| > 5% | Significant degradation | **Alert triggered** |

### Updating Configuration

**Change Thresholds:**
```python
# In 2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb, Cell 6.6
lambda_client.update_function_configuration(
    FunctionName='fraud-detection-drift-monitor',
    Environment={
        'Variables': {
            'DATA_DRIFT_THRESHOLD': '0.15',  # More sensitive
            'MODEL_DRIFT_THRESHOLD': '0.03',  # 3% degradation
            # ... other vars
        }
    }
)
```

**Change Schedule:**
```bash
aws events put-rule \
    --name fraud-detection-drift-check \
    --schedule-expression "cron(0 */6 * * ? *)"  # Every 6 hours
```

**Disable/Enable:**
```python
# In notebook or via AWS CLI
events = boto3.client('events')

# Disable
events.disable_rule(Name='fraud-detection-drift-check')

# Enable
events.enable_rule(Name='fraud-detection-drift-check')
```

### Troubleshooting

**No Emails Received:**
1. Check email confirmation - did you click the SNS subscription link?
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify SNS subscription status:
   ```bash
   aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic \
       --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:{account}:fraud-detection-drift-alerts
   ```

**Lambda Errors:**
```bash
# Check CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/fraud-detection-drift-monitor --since 1h
```

Common issues:
- Insufficient IAM permissions
- Athena query timeout (increase Lambda timeout)
- Not enough inference samples (need ≥100 samples)

**No Drift Detected:**
- Insufficient recent data (Lambda looks at last 24 hours)
- No ground truth for model drift (need labeled predictions)
- Drift below thresholds (check logs for actual PSI values)

### Cleanup

To remove all drift monitoring resources:

```bash
# Delete EventBridge rule
aws events remove-targets --rule fraud-detection-drift-check --ids 1
aws events delete-rule --name fraud-detection-drift-check

# Delete Lambda function
aws lambda delete-function --function-name fraud-detection-drift-monitor

# Delete IAM role and policies
aws iam detach-role-policy \
    --role-name fraud-detection-drift-monitor-role \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
aws iam delete-role-policy \
    --role-name fraud-detection-drift-monitor-role \
    --policy-name SNSPublishPolicy
aws iam delete-role --role-name fraud-detection-drift-monitor-role

# Delete SNS topic
aws sns delete-topic --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:{account}:fraud-detection-drift-alerts
```

### Best Practices

1. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Start with defaults (PSI=0.2, 5% degradation), adjust based on your use case
2. **Monitor Regularly**: Review CloudWatch logs weekly to understand drift patterns
3. **Investigate Quickly**: When alerts fire, investigate within 24 hours
4. **Update Baseline**: After retraining, update `BASELINE_ROC_AUC` in Lambda environment
5. **Test Monthly**: Manually trigger Lambda to ensure monitoring is working
6. **Keep Email List Current**: Update SNS subscriptions when team members change
7. **Document Investigations**: Log drift investigations in MLflow or tracking system

## Advanced Configuration

### Lambda Redeployment Control

By default, `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` checks if Lambda functions already exist before deploying them. This prevents unnecessary redeployment during notebook reruns.

**Configuration Flag (Cell 26):**
```python
# Set to True to force redeployment even if Lambda exists
REDEPLOY_LAMBDAS = False  # Default: skip if exists
```

**Behavior:**
- `False` (default): Checks if Lambda exists, skips deployment if found
- `True`: Always redeploys Lambda functions, even if they already exist

**Use Cases:**
- **Set to True** when you've modified Lambda code (e.g., `lambda_drift_monitor.py`, `lambda_inference_logger.py`)
- **Keep False** for routine notebook reruns to avoid unnecessary deployments and IAM role recreation

**Affected Lambdas:**
1. `fraud-monitoring-results-writer` (Cell 28) - Writes drift monitoring results to Athena
2. `fraud-detection-drift-monitor` (Cell 60) - Performs automated drift detection

### Drift Simulation Configuration

The ground truth simulator allows configurable drift scenarios for testing the monitoring system. This is critical for validating that drift detection triggers correctly before deploying to production.

**Configuration (Cell 15 in `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`):**
```python
# Ground Truth Simulation Configuration
SIM_ACCURACY = 0.85              # Base model accuracy (0.0-1.0)

# Feature drift (manifests as accuracy degradation)
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_MAG = 0.0      # How much features drift (0.0-1.0, semantic)
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_COUNT = 0      # Number of features drifting (semantic)
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT = 0.0   # Accuracy reduction from feature drift (0.0-1.0)

# Model drift (direct accuracy degradation)
SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG = 0.0        # Model accuracy degradation (0.0-1.0)
```

**How It Works:**
- **Base Accuracy**: Starting model performance (default 85%)
- **Feature Drift**: Simulates feature distribution changes that degrade model accuracy
  - `SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_MAG` and `SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_COUNT` are semantic parameters (documentation only)
  - `SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT` directly reduces effective accuracy (e.g., 0.10 = 10% reduction)
- **Model Drift**: Simulates direct model performance degradation
  - `SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG` directly reduces effective accuracy (e.g., 0.15 = 15% reduction)
- **Effective Accuracy**: `base_accuracy - feature_drift_impact - model_drift_mag` (minimum 50%)

**Testing Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 - No Drift (Baseline):**
```python
SIM_ACCURACY = 0.85
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT = 0.0
SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG = 0.0
# Effective accuracy: 85%
# Expected: No drift alerts
```

**Scenario 2 - Feature Drift:**
```python
SIM_ACCURACY = 0.85
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_MAG = 0.5      # 50% drift magnitude (semantic)
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_COUNT = 10     # 10 features drifting (semantic)
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT = 0.10  # 10% accuracy reduction
SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG = 0.0
# Effective accuracy: 75%
# Expected: Data drift detected, accuracy degradation alert
```

**Scenario 3 - Model Drift:**
```python
SIM_ACCURACY = 0.85
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT = 0.0
SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG = 0.15       # 15% degradation
# Effective accuracy: 70%
# Expected: Model drift alert, significant accuracy drop
```

**Scenario 4 - Combined Drift:**
```python
SIM_ACCURACY = 0.85
SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT = 0.08  # 8% from features
SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG = 0.07       # 7% from model
# Effective accuracy: 70%
# Expected: Both data drift and model drift detected
```

**Production Replacement:**
Replace `GroundTruthSimulator` with actual fraud investigation system that writes to `ground_truth_updates` table:
- Chargeback notifications
- Customer fraud reports
- Investigation team confirmations
- Merchant alerts

### Drift Data Generation Configuration

All drift generation parameters are centralized in `src/config/config.yaml` under the `drift_generation` section. This eliminates hardcoded values and makes it easy to adjust drift amounts for testing.

**Configuration Location:** `src/config/config.yaml` (lines 241-383)

**Default Drift Dataset (`generate_drift_dataset.py`):**
```yaml
drift_generation:
  default_drift:
    transaction_amount:
      type: "multiplicative"
      factor: 1.4      # 40% increase (simulates inflation)
      noise: 0.1       # ±10% random variation
    
    distance_from_home_km:
      type: "multiplicative"
      factor: 2.0      # 100% increase (travel/remote transactions)
      noise: 0.3       # ±30% random variation
    
    velocity_score:
      type: "multiplicative"
      factor: 1.5      # 50% increase (more active users)
      noise: 0.2
    
    num_transactions_24h:
      type: "additive"
      shift: 3         # Add 3 more transactions on average
      noise: 1
    
    transaction_timestamp:
      type: "additive"
      shift: 50000     # Shift time forward
      noise: 5000
  
  # Number of samples and reproducibility
  num_samples: 5000
  random_state: 123
```

**Variable Drift Patterns (`generate_variable_drift_dataset.py`):**

The system supports 6 time-varying drift scenarios for realistic testing:

```yaml
drift_generation:
  variable_patterns:
    run1:  # Baseline - minimal drift
      transaction_amount: {factor: 1.05, noise: 0.05}
      distance_from_home_km: {factor: 1.1, noise: 0.1}
    
    run2:  # Distance spike - travel surge
      distance_from_home_km: {factor: 3.5, noise: 0.5}  # 3.5x increase!
      velocity_score: {factor: 1.3, noise: 0.2}
    
    run3:  # Credit limit anomaly - system change
      credit_limit: {factor: 8.0, noise: 2.0}  # 8x increase! (PSI ~74)
      merchant_category_code: {shift: 500, noise: 200}
    
    run4:  # High velocity period
      velocity_score: {factor: 2.5, noise: 0.4}
      num_transactions_24h: {shift: 5, noise: 2}
    
    run5:  # Recovery - returning to normal
      transaction_amount: {factor: 1.2, noise: 0.15}
    
    run6:  # Account age anomaly - new user cohort
      account_age_days: {factor: 0.3, noise: 0.1}  # Younger accounts
```

**To Adjust Drift Amounts:**

1. **Edit config.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   drift_generation:
     variable_patterns:
       run3:
         credit_limit:
           factor: 1.5  # Reduce from 8.0 to 1.5 (20% drift instead of 800%)
           noise: 0.2   # Reduce from 2.0 to 0.2
   ```

2. **Regenerate drifted datasets:**
   ```bash
   python src/drift_monitoring/generate_drift_dataset.py
   python src/drift_monitoring/generate_variable_drift_dataset.py
   ```

3. **Test the new drift levels** in notebook 2a or via endpoint invocations

**Drift Types:**
- **Multiplicative:** `new_value = original_value × (factor ± noise × factor)`
  - Example: `factor: 2.0, noise: 0.3` → value is multiplied by 1.4-2.6x
- **Additive:** `new_value = original_value + (shift ± noise)`
  - Example: `shift: 3, noise: 1` → value increased by 2-4

**Time-Based Drift Detection:**

The monitoring system now compares data within configurable time windows:

```yaml
monitoring:
  lookback_days: 30                  # Default monitoring window
  data_drift_lookback_days: 7        # Compare last 7 days for data drift
  model_drift_lookback_days: 30      # Compare last 30 days for model performance
  min_samples_for_drift: 100         # Minimum samples required
```

**Before:** Drift compared all historical inference data (LIMIT 5000)  
**After:** Drift compares recent inference data (last N days) vs training baseline

This ensures:
- Fair comparison (recent vs recent data)
- Consistent time periods
- No mixing of old and new inference data
- Configurable via environment variables for Lambda deployments

**Lambda Environment Variables:**
```python
# Override config.yaml defaults via environment variables
DATA_DRIFT_LOOKBACK_DAYS=14     # 2 weeks instead of 7 days
MODEL_DRIFT_LOOKBACK_DAYS=60    # 2 months instead of 30 days
```

### MLflow Run ID Tracking

Each drift monitoring execution creates a unique MLflow run with a UUID for complete traceability.

**Implementation:**
- Lambda function `fraud-detection-drift-monitor` generates unique run ID on every execution
- Stored in `monitoring_responses` Athena table under `mlflow_run_id` column
- Enables tracking of drift metrics over time in MLflow experiments

**Verification (in `4_optional_version_validation.ipynb`):**
```python
# Cell 12-13: Validate unique run IDs
query = """
    SELECT monitoring_run_id, monitoring_timestamp, mlflow_run_id,
           data_drift_detected, model_drift_detected
    FROM fraud_detection.monitoring_responses
    ORDER BY monitoring_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10
"""
unique_runs = athena_df['mlflow_run_id'].nunique()
print(f"✓ Unique MLflow run IDs: {unique_runs}")
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each drift test generates new UUID (e.g., `a3f7b2c1-...`, `d8e9f0a2-...`)
- No more generic "unknown" or "pipeline" values
- Full audit trail of all drift monitoring executions

**MLflow Experiment:**
- Experiment: `fraud-detection-drift_monitoring`
- Each run contains:
  - Drift metrics (per-feature drift scores, aggregate statistics)
  - Performance metrics (ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall)
  - Evidently HTML reports (data drift dashboard, classification dashboard)
  - Detection flags (data_drift_detected, model_drift_detected)

### QuickSight Dashboard Auto-Refresh

The governance dashboard automatically refreshes daily with the latest drift monitoring results.

**Architecture:**
```
2:00 AM UTC → Drift Monitoring Lambda (fraud-detection-drift-monitor)
              ├─ Runs Evidently drift detection
              ├─ Logs metrics to MLflow
              └─ Writes results to monitoring_responses Athena table

                 ⏱️ Wait 1 hour for data to settle...

3:00 AM UTC → QuickSight Refresh Lambda (quicksight-dashboard-refresh)
              ├─ Triggers SPICE ingestion for 3 datasets:
              │  ├─ Inference Monitoring Dataset
              │  ├─ Drift Monitoring Dataset
              │  └─ Feature Drift Analysis Dataset
              └─ Dashboard shows updated data by morning
```

**Components Created (Cells 74-75 in `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`):**

1. **Lambda Function**: `quicksight-dashboard-refresh`
   - Runtime: Python 3.11
   - Memory: 128 MB
   - Environment Variables:
     - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
     - `INFERENCE_DATASET_ID`
     - `DRIFT_DATASET_ID`
     - `FEATURE_DRIFT_DATASET_ID`

2. **IAM Role**: `quicksight-dashboard-refresh-role`
   - Permissions: `quicksight:CreateIngestion`, `quicksight:DescribeIngestion`

3. **EventBridge Rule**: `quicksight-dashboard-daily-refresh`
   - Schedule: `cron(0 3 * * ? *)` (3:00 AM UTC daily)
   - Target: `quicksight-dashboard-refresh` Lambda

**Manual Refresh (Cell 2 in `3_governance_dashboard.ipynb`):**
```python
# Quick refresh cell at top of governance dashboard notebook
# Refreshes all 3 QuickSight datasets immediately
# Use after new drift monitoring runs or inference predictions
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check EventBridge schedule
aws events describe-rule --name quicksight-dashboard-daily-refresh

# View Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/quicksight-dashboard-refresh --follow

# Check QuickSight ingestion history
# Go to QuickSight Console → Datasets → Refresh tab
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual dashboard refresh required
- Always see latest data by morning (after 3 AM UTC refresh)
- Automated after drift monitoring completes
- Cost: <$1/month (Lambda + EventBridge)

**Customization:**
```python
# Change refresh schedule (in Cell 75)
events.put_rule(
    Name='quicksight-dashboard-daily-refresh',
    ScheduleExpression='cron(0 6 * * ? *)',  # 6 AM UTC instead
    State='ENABLED'
)
```

## Athena Data Lake

### Iceberg Tables

**training_data:**
- 284,080 rows, 33 columns (30 features + 3 metadata)
- Partitioned by: None (static training data)
- Features: See "Feature Format" section below

**inference_responses:**
- All predictions from deployed endpoint
- Partitioned by: `year`, `month`, `day`
- Schema: inference_id, request_timestamp, prediction, probability_fraud, ground_truth, latency_ms, confidence_score, transaction_context
- The `ground_truth` column starts as NULL and gets populated by the ground truth update process

**ground_truth_updates:**
- Lightweight table for merging confirmed labels back into `inference_responses`
- Schema: inference_id, actual_fraud, confirmation_timestamp, confirmation_source, investigation_notes
- **Populated by:** Ground truth simulator (dev/test) or fraud investigation systems (production)
- **Consumed by:** `src/drift_monitoring/update_ground_truth.py` which runs an Athena MERGE to update the `ground_truth` column in `inference_responses`
- JOINs on `inference_id` (not `transaction_id`)

**ground_truth (not used in current PoC):**
- Designed for a future **batch retraining** workflow
- Stores complete feature rows (all 33 columns) alongside confirmed fraud labels
- Unlike `ground_truth_updates` (which only patches `inference_responses`), this table holds full feature vectors for training a new model version
- Would be populated by a batch job that combines `inference_responses` + confirmed labels into training-ready rows
- Not needed for the current monitoring workflow — only relevant when building an automated retraining pipeline

**drifted_data:**
- Samples flagged for drift analysis
- Used for retraining prioritization

### Ground Truth Data Flow

```
inference_responses                ground_truth_updates
(predictions, ground_truth=NULL)   (inference_id + actual_fraud)
         │                                    │
         └──────── MERGE ON inference_id ──────┘
                          │
                          ▼
              inference_responses
              (ground_truth populated)
                          │
                          ▼
               Monitoring & Drift Detection
              (metrics where ground_truth IS NOT NULL)
```

**Key distinction:**
- `ground_truth_updates` → patches existing predictions (lightweight, used now)
- `ground_truth` → stores full feature rows for retraining (heavyweight, future use)

### Querying Athena

**Check inference logging:**
```sql
-- Recent predictions
SELECT
    inference_id,
    request_timestamp,
    prediction,
    probability_fraud,
    ground_truth,
    confidence_score
FROM fraud_detection.inference_responses
ORDER BY request_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Ground truth coverage:**
```sql
-- Coverage by day
SELECT
    DATE(request_timestamp) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total_predictions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ground_truth IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_ground_truth,
    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN ground_truth IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DOUBLE) / COUNT(*) * 100 as coverage_pct
FROM fraud_detection.inference_responses
GROUP BY DATE(request_timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Model performance:**
```sql
-- Confusion matrix
SELECT
    prediction,
    ground_truth,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM fraud_detection.inference_responses
WHERE ground_truth IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY prediction, ground_truth;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Execution Issues

**Issue:** Preprocessing fails with "Unable to verify/create output bucket"

```
InvalidRequestException: Unable to verify/create output bucket fraud-detection-data-lake
```

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` has correct bucket name with account ID suffix:
   ```bash
   DATA_S3_BUCKET=fraud-detection-data-lake-YOUR_ACCOUNT
   ```
2. Verify bucket exists:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://fraud-detection-data-lake-YOUR_ACCOUNT/
   ```
3. Create bucket if missing:
   ```bash
   python main.py setup
   ```

---

**Issue:** Training fails with "Feature count mismatch"

```
ModelError: Expected 30 features, got 32
```

**Solution:**
- Model expects exactly 30 training features
- Check `TRAINING_FEATURES` list in `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` Cell 4
- Do not include `transaction_id` or `transaction_timestamp` (metadata columns)

---

**Issue:** Pipeline fails with "FileNotFoundError: 'awswrangler'"

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'awswrangler'
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify `inference_requirements.txt` exists:
   ```bash
   cat src/train_pipeline/inference_requirements.txt
   ```
2. Should contain:
   ```
   awswrangler>=3.0.0
   boto3>=1.34.0
   pandas>=2.0.0
   ```
3. Restart Jupyter kernel if running in notebook
4. Redeploy pipeline

---

### MLflow Integration Issues

**Issue:** Can't access MLflow UI

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're in SageMaker Studio (not local environment)
2. Navigate: Left sidebar → Partner AI Apps → MLflow
3. Click on your MLflow app name
4. Opens authenticated session in new tab

---

**Issue:** MLflow tracking URI not working

```
MlflowException: Unable to connect to tracking server
```

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` has ARN format (not HTTPS):
   ```bash
   # ✓ Correct (for SDK)
   MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:123456:mlflow-app/app-ABC123

   # ✗ Wrong (for web UI only)
   MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://abc123.mlflow-tracking.us-east-1.sagemaker.aws/
   ```
2. Verify IAM role has MLflow access:
   ```bash
   python -m src.setup.create_or_update_sagemaker_role
   ```

---

**Issue:** Training dependencies not installed

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sagemaker_mlflow'
```

**Solution:**
1. Check training step has dependencies configured:
   ```python
   # In pipeline.py training step
   dependencies=['pipeline_steps/requirements_train.txt']
   ```
2. Verify `requirements_train.txt` contains:
   ```
   sagemaker-mlflow>=0.1.0
   mlflow>=2.17.0
   ```

---

### Inference & Monitoring Issues

**Issue:** No records in Athena after inference

**Solution:**
1. Check endpoint uses custom handler (not built-in XGBoost)
2. Verify CloudWatch logs show:
   ```
   ✓ Athena client initialized for inference logging
   ```
3. Make 50+ predictions to trigger buffer flush:
   ```python
   # Buffer flushes at 50 records
   # Cell 6 (5 predictions) + Cell 9 (50 predictions) = 55 total
   # This should automatically trigger the batch flush
   ```
4. Or wait 5 minutes for time-based flush

---

**Issue:** Timestamp precision error in Athena queries

```
NOT_SUPPORTED: Incorrect timestamp precision for timestamp(6)
```

**Solution:**
1. Athena Iceberg tables use `TIMESTAMP(3)` (milliseconds)
2. Cast aggregations explicitly:
   ```sql
   CAST(MIN(request_timestamp) AS TIMESTAMP(3))
   ```
3. All timestamp aggregations (MIN, MAX, AVG) must be cast
4. See `TIMESTAMP_FIX.md` for complete fix details

---

**Issue:** Ground truth simulation returns 0 records

```
No predictions found without ground truth
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify inference_responses table has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fraud_detection.inference_responses;
   ```
2. Check predictions don't already have ground truth:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fraud_detection.inference_responses
   WHERE ground_truth IS NULL;
   ```
3. Run inference tests first (notebook Cells 6-9)

---

### Infrastructure Issues

**Issue:** IAM role lacks permissions

```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: athena:StartQueryExecution
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Update SageMaker role with all required permissions
python -m src.setup.create_or_update_sagemaker_role

# Grants access to:
# - S3 (read/write)
# - Athena (queries, Iceberg tables)
# - Glue (data catalog)
# - Lake Formation (table permissions)
# - MLflow (tracking server)
# - Lambda (for deployment step)
```

---

**Issue:** Corrupted Athena query results

```
SYNTAX_ERROR: line 1:8: Column 'cnt' cannot be resolved
```

**Solution:**
1. Corrupted metadata in S3
2. Clean up corrupted results:
   ```bash
   ./src/setup/cleanup_corrupted_athena_results.sh
   ```
3. Or manually delete:
   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://YOUR_BUCKET/athena-query-results/tables/ --recursive
   ```

---

### Performance Issues

**Issue:** Inference latency too high (>500ms)

**Expected:** 100-200ms P95 latency

**Solution:**
1. Check if cold start (first request ~2-5 seconds)
2. Verify endpoint instance type (ml.m5.xlarge recommended)
3. Check CloudWatch metrics for throttling
4. Consider increasing serverless concurrency
5. Background Athena logging should add <50ms

---

## Complete End-to-End Workflow

### 1. Setup Infrastructure

```bash
# One-time setup
python -m src.setup.upload_data_to_s3
python main.py setup --migrate-data
```

**Result:** S3 bucket, Athena database, Iceberg tables created, CSV data uploaded and migrated

---

### 2. Train & Deploy Model via Pipeline

**Option A: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)**

```bash
# In SageMaker Studio, open:
notebooks/1_training_pipeline.ipynb

# Run sequentially:
# - Cells 1-3: Setup and configuration
# - Cell 4: Create/update pipeline definition
# - Cell 5: Execute pipeline and wait (~25 minutes)
```

**Option B: CLI**

```bash
python main.py pipeline create --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline --wait
```

**Result:**
- Model trained with XGBoost
- Evaluated (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, confusion matrix)
- Registered in MLflow Model Registry
- Deployed to serverless endpoint with custom handler

---

### 3. Run Inference & Monitoring

**Open:** `notebooks/2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`

This notebook handles the complete inference and monitoring workflow:

#### 3a. Test Inference (Cells 1-9)

```bash
# In 2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb:
# Cell 1-2: Setup (load environment, initialize clients)
# Cell 4: Load test data and verify features
# Cell 5: Quick single test (optional)
# Cell 6: Single inference tests (5 samples)
# Cell 8: Generate playground samples (for SageMaker Studio testing)
# Cell 9: Bulk inference test (50 samples)
```

**Result:**
- Predictions returned with fraud probabilities
- Automatically logged to `inference_responses` table (custom handler)
- Latency metrics captured

**Verify automatic logging:**
```bash
# Cell 10: Check Athena for logged predictions
# Should show records after 100 predictions or 5 minutes
```

#### 3b. Simulate Ground Truth (Cells 20-22)

**For Development/Testing:**

```bash
# In 2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb:
# Cell 20: Run ground truth simulator
# - Simulates fraud investigation outcomes
# - Creates realistic confirmation delays
# - Configurable accuracy (default 85%)

# Or via CLI:
python -m src.monitoring.simulate_ground_truth_from_athena --accuracy 0.85
```

**For Production:**
Replace simulation with actual fraud investigation system that writes to `ground_truth_updates` table:
- Chargeback notifications
- Customer fraud reports
- Investigation team confirmations
- Merchant alerts

**Result:** Ground truth updates in `ground_truth_updates` table

#### 3c. Apply Ground Truth Updates (Cell 19 or CLI)

```bash
# In 2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb:
# Cell 19: Apply updates using notebook

# Or via CLI:
python -m src.monitoring.update_ground_truth --mode batch
```

**Result:** `inference_responses.ground_truth` column populated via MERGE

#### 3d. Verify Coverage (Cell 22)

```bash
# Cell 22: Check ground truth coverage
# Shows: total predictions, with/without ground truth, coverage %
```

**Expected:** 100% coverage (simulated) or partial coverage (production)

#### 3e. Monitor Performance & Detect Drift (Cells 27-40)

```bash
# Cell 27: Initialize performance monitor
# Cell 28: Generate performance report
# Cell 29: Display metrics (ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1)
# Cell 32: Run Evidently data drift detection (DataDriftPreset)
# Cell 33: Display interactive Evidently data drift report
# Cell 35: Run Evidently model drift detection (ClassificationPreset)
# Cell 36: Display interactive Evidently classification report
# Cell 38: Log Evidently HTML reports and metrics to MLflow
# Cell 40: Check for alerts (performance degradation)
```

**Result:**
- Performance metrics calculated (where ground truth exists)
- Evidently data drift report generated (PSI, KS, distribution comparisons)
- Evidently classification report generated (ROC, PR, confusion matrix, F1)
- Interactive HTML reports logged to MLflow as artifacts
- Per-feature drift scores and classification metrics logged as MLflow metrics
- Alerts if performance degraded >5%

> **📝 Note:** Evidently reports in cells 33 and 36 show as interactive HTML when running locally, but don't render on GitHub. See [report screenshots](docs/screenshots/evidently/) or check MLflow artifacts under `evidently_reports/` in production.

**Alternative: CLI monitoring (no charts):**
```bash
python -m src.monitoring.monitor_model_performance --days 30
```

---

### 4. Review Results in MLflow

```bash
# In SageMaker Studio:
# 1. Left sidebar → Partner AI Apps → MLflow
# 2. Select experiments:
#    - credit-card-fraud-detection-training (training runs)
#    - credit-card-fraud-detection-inference (monitoring runs)
# 3. View charts in Artifacts section
```

**Charts available:**
- Training: ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importance
- Monitoring: Evidently interactive HTML reports (data drift dashboard, classification dashboard)

---

### 5. Retrain if Needed

```bash
# If drift detected or performance degraded:

# Option A: Via 1_training_pipeline.ipynb
# Cell 5: Re-run pipeline execution

# Option B: Via CLI
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline --wait
```

**Result:**
- New model version trained with latest data
- Automatically registered in MLflow
- Deployed to same endpoint (replaces old model)

---

## Summary: Notebook Workflow

The entire PoC is driven by **three notebooks** in SageMaker Studio. Each notebook cell maps to a CLI command (see [Next Steps](#next-steps) for CI/CD equivalents).

| Notebook | Purpose | Key Cells |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **`1_training_pipeline.ipynb`** | Training, evaluation, model registration, endpoint deployment | Cells 1-5 |
| **`2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb`** | Inference testing, ground truth, drift detection, CloudWatch alarms | Cells 1-40 |
| **`inference_monitoring_with_pipeline.ipynb`** | Pipeline-based automated monitoring: creates a SageMaker Pipeline (`fraud-detection-monitoring-pipeline`) with steps for ground truth simulation, drift computation, MLflow logging, Athena writes, threshold checks, and alarm creation | Cells 1-end |
| **`3_governance_dashboard.ipynb`** | QuickSight governance dashboard: creates Athena data source, dataset, analysis with 6 visuals, and published dashboard — all via API | Cells 1-11 |
| **`4_optional_version_validation.ipynb`** | Version traceability: validates MLflow model version matches SageMaker endpoint and Athena logs | Cells 1-20 |
| **`5_optional_cleanup.ipynb`** | Resource cleanup: deletes all AWS resources (endpoints, Lambda, Athena tables, S3, CloudWatch) | Cells 1-38 |

**Workflow:**

1. **Train & Deploy:** `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` → Cells 1-5 (creates pipeline, trains model, deploys endpoint)
2. **Test Inference:** `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` → Cells 1-9 (single + bulk predictions, auto-logged to Athena)
3. **Simulate Ground Truth:** `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` → Cells 19-24 (generate and apply ground truth labels)
4. **Monitor & Detect Drift:** `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` → Cells 26-39 (performance metrics, data drift, model drift, MLflow logging)
5. **CloudWatch Alarms:** `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` → Cell 40 (publish metrics, create alarms & dashboard)
6. **MLflow Review:** SageMaker Studio → Partner AI Apps → MLflow
7. **Retrain:** `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` → Cell 5 (re-execute pipeline)

**Alternative: Pipeline-Based Monitoring**
`inference_monitoring_with_pipeline.ipynb` wraps steps 3-5 into a single SageMaker Pipeline (`fraud-detection-monitoring-pipeline`) with automated steps: SimulateGroundTruth → ComputeDrift → LogToMLflow → WriteToAthena → CheckThresholds → CreateAlarms. Use this for scheduled, hands-off monitoring.

**All in SageMaker Studio — no CLI needed for development workflow.**

---

### Inference Monitoring with SageMaker Pipeline

`notebooks/inference_monitoring_with_pipeline.ipynb` sets up inference monitoring as a fully automated SageMaker Pipeline instead of running individual notebook cells manually.

**What it does:**
- Creates a 6-step SageMaker Pipeline: SimulateGroundTruth → ComputeDrift → LogToMLflow → WriteToAthena → CheckThresholds → CreateAlarms
- Auto-resolves the MLflow run ID and model version from the MLflow Model Registry (no hardcoded run IDs)
- Queries monitoring results from Athena and visualizes drift trends over time
- Configures EventBridge scheduling for daily automated execution (Section 11) — creates the IAM role, rule, and wires the pipeline as a direct EventBridge target using `SageMakerPipelineParameters`

**Key sections:**
1. Setup — auto-resolves model version from MLflow Model Registry (prefers Production stage)
2. Pipeline creation and execution with configurable thresholds
3. Athena result queries and drift trend visualization
4. EventBridge scheduling for daily hands-off monitoring (no Lambda intermediary)

### Governance Dashboard (QuickSight)

`notebooks/3_governance_dashboard.ipynb` programmatically creates a complete QuickSight governance dashboard — no manual UI steps required.

**What it creates (all via QuickSight Definition API):**
- Athena data source pointing to the `fraud_detection` database
- Dataset from `inference_responses` table with calculated fields (`prediction_accuracy`, `risk_tier`)
- Analysis with 6 visuals: prediction volume over time, fraud probability distribution, prediction accuracy breakdown (donut), risk tier distribution, inference latency trend, and total inferences KPI
- Published dashboard with filtering and CSV export enabled

**Prerequisites:** QuickSight Enterprise subscription, data in `inference_responses` Athena table, IAM permissions for QuickSight/Athena/S3.

**QuickSight Governance Dashboard:**

> 📄 [View Governance Dashboard (PDF)](docs/screenshots/quicksight/Quicksight-Governance-dashboard.pdf)

**Extending with Feature-Level Drift Analysis:**

The default dashboard provides high-level inference and model performance metrics. For detailed feature-level drift analysis, you can extend the dashboard with additional visuals:

- **Feature Drift Timeline**: Line chart showing how individual features drift over time (compare credit_limit vs. merchant_category vs. account_age)
- **Top Drifting Features**: Horizontal bar chart ranking features by average drift score
- **Drift Severity Distribution**: Stacked bar chart showing Low/Moderate/Significant drift counts per feature
- **Feature Drift Detail Table**: Sortable table with all feature drift metrics

**Implementation:** The [Feature-Level Drift Analysis Guide](docs/screenshots/quicksight/FEATURE_LEVEL_SUMMARY.md) provides:
- Pre-built Athena view (`feature_drift_detail`) that unpacks per-feature drift scores
- Copy-paste Python code to add 6 new visuals to your dashboard
- SQL queries and visualization configurations
- Step-by-step implementation checklist

**When to use:** Add these visuals when you need to:
- Investigate which specific features are drifting (not just overall drift detection)
- Prioritize retraining efforts by identifying the worst offenders
- Distinguish data quality issues from genuine distribution shifts
- Monitor drift patterns across your 29+ input features

## Cost Optimization

**Training:**
- Use Spot instances for training: significantly lower compute costs
- Training completes in 10-15 min, low spot interruption risk
- Configure in pipeline: `instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge"`, `use_spot_instances=True`

**Inference:**
- Serverless inference: Pay per invocation with automatic scaling to zero when idle
- Cold start: 10-30 seconds (acceptable for fraud detection)
- Alternative: Provision dedicated instances for high-volume scenarios with predictable traffic

**Storage:**
- Athena Iceberg tables: Pay per query, not storage
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for model artifacts
- Compress old inference logs to Glacier after 90 days

**Estimated Monthly Costs (1000 predictions/day):**
- Training: ~$5-10 (spot instances, 2-3 retrainings/month)
- Inference: ~$20-30 (serverless)
- Storage: ~$5-10 (S3 + Athena)
- MLflow: Included in SageMaker AI Notebooks
- **Total: ~$30-50/month**

## Model Versioning & Lifecycle

### Version Stages

Models progress through stages in MLflow Model Registry:

1. **None** - Newly registered, not validated
2. **Staging** - Undergoing validation/testing
3. **Production** - Serving live traffic
4. **Archived** - Retired

### Promoting Models

```python
# In MLflow UI or via SDK
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Promote to staging
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="xgboost-fraud-detector",
    version=3,
    stage="Staging"
)

# After validation, promote to production
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="xgboost-fraud-detector",
    version=3,
    stage="Production"
)

# Archive old version
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="xgboost-fraud-detector",
    version=2,
    stage="Archived"
)
```

### Version Metadata

Each version includes:
- **Metrics:** ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, precision, recall, F1
- **Parameters:** max_depth, learning_rate, scale_pos_weight, etc.
- **Tags:** `training_date`, `pipeline_execution_id`, `deployed_endpoint`
- **Artifacts:** model.xgb, feature_metadata.json, preprocessing config

### Rollback Strategy

```bash
# If new model performs poorly:

# 1. Check recent performance
python -m src.monitoring.monitor_model_performance --days 7

# 2. If degraded, rollback to previous version in MLflow UI:
#    - Mark current version as "Archived"
#    - Mark previous version as "Production"

# 3. Redeploy with previous model version
#    Update pipeline to use previous run_id
python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline
```

## Next Steps

### CI/CD: From Notebooks to Automation

Each notebook cell has a direct CLI equivalent. For CI/CD pipelines, replace notebook interactions with these commands:

| Phase | Notebook Cell | CLI Command |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Infrastructure | `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` Cell 3 | `python main.py setup --migrate-data` |
| SQS + Lambda | `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` Cell 3 | `python main.py setup-logging` |
| Create Pipeline | `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` Cell 4 | `python main.py pipeline create --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline` |
| Train & Deploy | `1_training_pipeline.ipynb` Cell 5 | `python main.py pipeline start --pipeline-name fraud-detection-pipeline --wait` |
| Test Inference | `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` Cells 6-9 | `python main.py test --endpoint-name fraud-detector-endpoint --num-samples 100` |
| Simulate Ground Truth | `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` Cell 19 | `python -m src.monitoring.simulate_ground_truth_from_athena --accuracy 0.85` |
| Apply Ground Truth | `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` Cell 24 | `python -m src.monitoring.update_ground_truth --mode batch` |
| Monitor Drift | `2a_inference_monitoring.ipynb` Cells 26-39 | `python -m src.monitoring.monitor_model_performance --days 30` |

### Scheduled Monitoring

Automate drift checks with EventBridge + Lambda:

1. **EventBridge Rule:** Schedule `monitor_model_performance.py` daily/hourly via a Lambda function
2. **Lambda wrapper:** Package the monitoring script as a Lambda that queries Athena and publishes CloudWatch metrics
3. **Trigger retraining:** If drift exceeds thresholds, start the SageMaker Pipeline automatically

### SNS Notifications

Connect CloudWatch alarms (created in Cell 40) to email or Slack:

```bash
# 1. Create SNS topic
aws sns create-topic --name FraudDetection-DriftAlerts

# 2. Subscribe email
aws sns subscribe \
  --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT:FraudDetection-DriftAlerts \
  --protocol email \
  --notification-endpoint your-team@example.com

# 3. Update alarms to notify (repeat for each alarm)
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name FraudDetection-ModelDrift-ROC-AUC \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT:FraudDetection-DriftAlerts \
  # ... (keep existing alarm configuration)
```

For Slack, use an SNS → Lambda → Slack webhook integration or AWS Chatbot.

## Version History

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-03-24 | **README Major Revision**: Removed duplicate "Complete Architecture" ASCII art section (136 lines) since visual diagrams (architecture_diagram.png, inference_monitoring_diagram.png) provide better visualization. Enhanced Overview section with comprehensive explanation of ML governance importance, production monitoring challenges, and solution benefits. Added "Advanced Configuration" section documenting recent features: (1) `REDEPLOY_LAMBDAS` flag for Lambda redeployment control, (2) drift simulation configuration with test scenarios (`SIM_ACCURACY`, `SIM_FEATURE_DRIFT_IMPACT`, `SIM_MODEL_DRIFT_MAG`), (3) MLflow run ID tracking with unique UUIDs per drift test, (4) QuickSight dashboard auto-refresh automation (3 AM UTC daily after drift monitoring at 2 AM). Updated all three architecture diagrams to reflect latest pipeline additions. Added EventBridge + Lambda dataset refresh flow to Governance Dashboard (QuickSight) lane. Added `config.yaml` drift metrics configuration node with file icon. Regenerated all PNG diagrams. |
| 2026-03-21 | Added drift trend analysis visuals to `3_governance_dashboard.ipynb`: second QuickSight dataset (`monitoring_responses`) and Sheet 2 with 6 new visuals (drift share over time, drifted feature counts, ROC-AUC baseline vs current, model performance multi-line, drift alerts timeline, drift KPI). Aligned `setup_quicksight_governance.py` column names with actual `monitoring_responses` Iceberg schema. Added Lake Formation grants for all tables (caller IAM role + Lambda role). Fixed SSO assumed-role ARN resolution for Lake Formation. Standardized table name to `monitoring_responses` across codebase. Added notebook cell to write Evidently drift metrics directly to `monitoring_responses` Athena table. Inference handler now resolves `model_version` and `mlflow_run_id` dynamically from MLflow registry at model load time. Pipeline model step passes `MODEL_VERSION` and `MLFLOW_RUN_ID` env vars. Added "Why Not SageMaker DataCaptureConfig?" section to README. Fixed notebook cell ordering, MLflow tracking URI, Lake Formation Principal parameter, screenshot path, and various module/dependency issues. Renamed directory from `automated-drift_monitoring-evidently` to `sagemaker-automated-drift-and-trend-monitoring`. |
| 2026-03-18 | Initial documentation v3.0 with Evidently integration, MLflow tracking, and SageMaker pipeline. |

## SageMaker SDK v3 Migration

This codebase has been migrated to **SageMaker Python SDK v3.7.1**, which reorganizes the SDK into separate packages (`sagemaker-core`, `sagemaker-train`, `sagemaker-mlops`, `sagemaker-serve`). Key changes:

- **Training:** `XGBoost` estimator replaced by `ModelTrainer` from `sagemaker.train.model_trainer` with explicit `SourceCode`, `Compute`, and `OutputDataConfig` objects
- **Model registration:** `RegisterModel` step collection replaced by `ModelStep` + `ModelBuilder.register()` from `sagemaker.serve.model_builder`
- **Model creation:** `CreateModelStep` + `XGBoostModel` replaced by `ModelStep` + `ModelBuilder.build()`
- **Deployment:** `Model.deploy()` replaced by `ModelBuilder.deploy()` with `ServerlessInferenceConfig` from `sagemaker.serve.serverless`
- **Session:** `sagemaker.Session()` replaced by `Session` from `sagemaker.core.helper.session_helper`
- **Image URIs:** `sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve()` replaced by `retrieve` from `sagemaker.core.image_uris`
- **Processing:** Imports moved from `sagemaker.processing` to `sagemaker.core.processing`; `SKLearnProcessor` removed (use `ScriptProcessor` or `FrameworkProcessor`)
- **Workflow:** Pipeline and step imports moved from `sagemaker.workflow.*` to `sagemaker.mlops.workflow.*` and `sagemaker.core.workflow.*`

All pipeline behavior, step flow, parameters, and environment variables are preserved — only the SDK API surface changed.
